<p>Datalegreya is a typeface which can interweave data curves with text. It is designed by Figs, on the basis of open source font Alegreya Sans SC Thin by Argentine typographer
Juan Pablo del Peral.</p>
<p>Datalegreya can be used in all contexts where small space is available to synthetically display graphical data: connected objects, embedded displays, annual reports, weather report, stock prices, etc.</p>
<p>Most connected objects feature a small sized screen, and all of them are about data. By its hybrid design aimed to displaying text and data in compact spaces, Datalegreya brings a realistic and elegant solution to this ever growing market’s specific issues.</p>
<p>It doesn’t need any specialized software: users just have to install it in the operating system and launch any software able to display OpenType fonts, such as Microsoft Word, Apple TextEdit, Adobe Suite etc.
Standards compliance makes it equally available on the web or software embedded.</p>
